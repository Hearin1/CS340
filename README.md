1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I focused on using clear naming conventions, modular design, and comprehensive comments in the code. For the CRUD Python module, each function (Create, Read, Update, Delete) was encapsulated to serve a single purpose, making it easy to debug and reuse. This modular approach allowed seamless integration with the dashboard in Project Two, as it separated the logic from the interface, promoting scalability. Working this way made it easier to test and adapt the module to new requirements, and in the future, it could be repurposed for other database-driven projects or expanded to support additional functionality like complex queries or user authentication.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components and prioritizing functionality and efficiency. For Grazioso Salvare, I started by analyzing the database and dashboard requirements to identify key functionalities, such as seamless data retrieval and updates. Compared to previous assignments, this project required a deeper focus on user needs and real-world application, making scalability and performance more critical. In the future, I would continue using strategies like designing normalized database schemas and implementing error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure the database meets diverse client needs while remaining robust and secure.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists solve problems by designing and implementing efficient algorithms, systems, and applications to address real-world challenges. Their work matters because it drives innovation, streamlines processes, and enhances productivity across industries. For Grazioso Salvare, my work on the CRUD module and dashboard integration allowed the company to efficiently manage and analyze data, such as tracking animal rescues or generating reports, enabling faster decision-making. This project demonstrated how technology can optimize workflows, reduce errors, and support an organization in achieving its goals more effectively.
